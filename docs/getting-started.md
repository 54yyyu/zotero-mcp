# Getting Started with Zotero MCP

This guide will walk you through the setup and basic usage of the Zotero MCP server, which allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with your Zotero library.

## Installation

First, install the Zotero MCP server using pip:

```bash
pip install zotero-mcp
```

## Configuration

The server needs to know how to connect to your Zotero library. There are two main ways to do this:

### Option 1: Local Zotero (Recommended)

If you're running Zotero 7 or newer on the same machine, you can connect to the local API:

1. Enable the local API in Zotero's preferences:
   - Open Zotero
   - Go to Edit > Preferences > Advanced > API
   - Check "Enable local API"

2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ZOTERO_LOCAL=true
   ```

### Option 2: Zotero Web API

If you want to connect to your Zotero library via the web API:

1. Get your Zotero API key:
   - Go to [https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys)
   - Create a new key with appropriate permissions (at least "Read" access)
   
2. Find your library ID:
   - For personal libraries, your user ID is available at the same page
   - For group libraries, it's the number in the URL when viewing the group
   
3. Set the environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ZOTERO_API_KEY=your_api_key
   export ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID=your_library_id
   export ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE=user  # or 'group' for group libraries
   ```

## Integrating with Claude Desktop

To use Zotero MCP with Claude Desktop:

1. Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed
2. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:
   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the Zotero MCP server to the configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "zotero": {
         "command": "zotero-mcp",
         "env": {
           "ZOTERO_LOCAL": "true"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

## Using with Other MCP Clients

Zotero MCP works with any MCP-compatible client. You can start the server manually:

```bash
zotero-mcp --transport stdio
```

For HTTP/SSE-based clients:

```bash
zotero-mcp --transport sse --host localhost --port 8000
```

## Available Tools

When connected to Claude Desktop or another MCP client, you'll have access to these tools:

- **zotero_search_items**: Search your library by title, creator, or content
- **zotero_get_item_metadata**: Get detailed information about a specific item
- **zotero_get_item_fulltext**: Get the full text content of an item
- **zotero_get_collections**: List all collections in your library
- **zotero_get_collection_items**: Get all items in a specific collection
- **zotero_get_item_children**: Get child items (attachments, notes) for a specific item
- **zotero_get_tags**: Get all tags used in your library
- **zotero_get_recent**: Get recently added items to your library

## Example Queries

Once connected, you can ask Claude questions like:

- "Search my Zotero library for papers about machine learning"
- "Find articles by Smith in my Zotero library"
- "Show me my most recent additions to Zotero"
- "What collections do I have in my Zotero library?"
- "Get the full text of paper XYZ from my Zotero library"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Make sure Zotero is running (for local API)
- Check that your API key has the correct permissions
- Verify your library ID and type
- Look for error messages in the Claude Desktop logs or MCP server output
